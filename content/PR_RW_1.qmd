Puerto Rico Yellowtail Snapper Review Workshop Model PR_RW_1. (a) Length at age in the beginning of the year (or season) in the final year of the model. Shaded area indicates 95% distribution of length at age around estimated growth curve; (b) observed and expected landings; (c) selectivity at length by fleet; and (d) fit to index data for the NCRMP survey.

![Length fit](/Scenarios/PR_RW_1/plots/comp_lenfit__multi-fleet_comparison.png)

Puerto Rico Yellowtail Snapper Review Workshop Model PR_RW_1. (a) Observed and predicted length distributions in centimeters, aggregated across time by fleet. 'N adj.' is the input sample size after data-weighting adjustment. N eff. is the calculated effective sample size used in the McAllister-Ianelli tuning method; and (b) Pearson residuals, comparing across fleets. Closed bubbles are positive residuals (observed \> expected) and open bubbles are negative residuals (observed \< expected).

Puerto Rico Yellowtail Snapper Review Workshop Model PR_RW_1. (a) Time series of SPR. Horizontal reference line is at SPR target: 0.4; (b) time series of 1-SPR. Horizontal reference lines 1 and at 1 - SPR target: 1 - 0.4 = 0.6; (c) the relative spawning stock biomass (total biomass / virgin spawning stock biomass) with \~95% asymptotic intervals. Horizontal reference line at SPR target: 0.4; and (d) phase plot of biomass ratio vs. SPR ratio where warmer colors (red) represent early years and colder colors (blue) represent recent years. Lines through the final point show 95% intervals based on the asymptotic uncertainty for each dimension. The shaded ellipse is a 95% region which accounts for the estimated correlation between the two quantities: -0.567.
