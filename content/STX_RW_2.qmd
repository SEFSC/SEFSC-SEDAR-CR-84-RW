St. Croix Stoplight Parrotfish Review Workshop Model STX_RW_2. (a) Length at age in the beginning of the year (or season) in the final year of the model. Shaded area indicates 95% distribution of length at age around estimated growth curve; (b) observed and expected landings; (c) selectivity at length by fleet; and (d) Fit to index data for the NCRMP survey.

![Length comps NCRMP](/Scenarios/STX_RW_2/plots/comp_lenfit_flt2mkt0.png)

St. Croix Stoplight Parrotfish Review Workshop Model STX_RW_2. (a) Observed and predicted length distributions in centimeters, aggregated across time by fleet; and (b) observed and predicted length distributions in centimeters, by year for the NCRMP survey. 'N adj.' is the input sample size after data-weighting adjustment. N eff. is the calculated effective sample size used in the McAllister-Ianelli tuning method.

St. Croix Stoplight Parrotfish Review Workshop Model STX_RW_2. (a) Pearson residuals, comparing across fleets. Closed bubbles are positive residuals (observed > expected) and open bubbles are negative residuals (observed < expected); and (b) mean length for the NCRMP survey with 95% confidence intervals.

St. Croix Stoplight Parrotfish Review Workshop Model STX_RW_2. (a) Recruitment deviations with 95% intervals; and (b) fishing mortality (total biomass killed / total biomass).

![STX_RW_2 Parameters](/Scenarios/STX_RW_2/plots/parameter_distributions.png)

St. Croix Stoplight Parrotfish Review Workshop Model STX_RW_2. (a) phase plot of biomass ratio vs. SPR ratio where warmer colors (red) represent early years and colder colors (blue) represent recent years. Lines through the final point show 95% intervals based on the asymptotic uncertainty for each dimension. The shaded ellipse is a 95% region which accounts for the estimated correlation between the two quantities: -0.112; and (b) parameter distribution plots.

St. Croix Stoplight Parrotfish Review Workshop Model STX_RW_1. (a) Time series of SPR. Horizontal reference line is at SPR target: 0.4, (b) time series of 1-SPR. Horizontal reference lines 1 and at 1 - SPR target: 1 - 0.4 = 0.6; and (c) the relative spawning stock biomass (total biomass / virgin spawning stock biomass) with ~95% asymptotic intervals. Horizontal reference lines at 1 and SPR target: 0.4.
